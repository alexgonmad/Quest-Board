  - Flutter (stable channel), Dart (latest stable).

- Core Packages

  - Lints/format: `flutter_lints`, `dart format`.
  - Env/config: `--dart-define` (per flavor).
  - Logging: simple structured logs (upgrade as needed).

- Testing
  - Unit tests (business logic, utils).
  - Widget tests for critical flows (task list, creation).
  - Coverage threshold: start â‰¥60% (raise over time).

- CI/CD
  - GitHub Actions: analyze + test on every PR; build pipelines later.

- Design & Assets
  - Design source: Figma.
  - Theming: Material 3 (light/dark), PMD-inspired visuals.

- Backend / Sync (TBD)
